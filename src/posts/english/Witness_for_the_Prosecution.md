18
Teeny-weeny steps, now. Remember
we had a teeny-weeny heart attack.

19
Oh, shut up!

20
Williams, my cane.

21
Here he comes!

22
Good afternoon. Thank you very much.
Everybody back to work.

23
Sir Wilfrid, if you don't mind, I'd like
to read you a poem to welcome you back.

24
Very touching. You can recite it
after office hours in your own time.

25
Now back to work.
What's the matter with you?

26
Nothing. I'm just happy
that you're your old self again.

27
Any more sentimentality around here,
I shall go back to the hospital!

28
They won't take him back.
He wasn't really discharged, you know,

29
he was expelled for conduct
unbecoming a cardiac patient.

30
Put these in water, blabbermouth!
Come on in, Carter.

31
Look at this room.
It's ugly, old and musty.

32
But I never knew
I could miss anything so much.

33
- Missed you too, you musty old buzzard.
- Oh, thank you, sir.

34
I'm not a religious man, but when they
carted you off, I went out and lit a candle.

35
- Why, thank you, Carter.
- Actually, sir, I was lighting it for myself.

36
If anything happened to you,
what would happen to me, after 37 years?

37
37 years! Has it been all that long?

38
Yes, sir. This is 1952, that was in October
1.    The Shepherd's Bush murder.

39
The chemist accused of putting
cyanide in his uncle's toothpaste.

40
My first murder trial.
I was more frightened than the defendant.

41
First time I rose to make an objection,
my wig fell off. Where's my wig?

42
Right here.

43
- I've guarded it with me life.
- I hope it still fits.

44
I lost 30lbs in that wretched hospital.

45
Still, I suppose my head isn't any smaller.

46
What's all this?

47
- We've put it in mothballs.
- Mothballs? Am I not to practise again?

48
Of course. The solicitors
have been breaking down our doors.

49
- I've got some interesting briefs for you.
- That's better.

50
Divorce case, a tax appeal,
and an important marine insurance claim.

51
- Nice smooth matters with excellent fees.
- No, Carter.

52
I'm sorry, but you're not to undertake
any criminal cases. Your doctors have...

53
Doctors! They've deprived me of alcohol,
tobacco, female companionship.

54
If only they'd let me do
something worthwhile!

55
Sorry, sir.

56
Might as well get a bigger box,
more mothballs, put me away too.

57
- 2.30, Sir Wilfrid. Time for our little nap!
- Oh, get out!

58
Beddy-bye. We'd better go upstairs now,
get undressed and lie down.

59
- We? What a nauseating prospect.
- Upstairs, please.

60
Are you aware that, while on my sickbed,

61
I seriously considered strangling you
with one of your own rubber tubes.

62
I would then have admitted the crime,
retained myself for the defence.

63
My lord, members of the jury, I hereby
enter a plea of justifiable homicide.

64
For four months this alleged
angel of mercy has pored, probed,

65
punctured, pillaged and plundered
my helpless body

66
while tormenting my mind
with a steady drip of baby talk.

67
Come along now, like a good boy. Oh, no.

68
Take your hands off me,
or I'll strike you with my cane.

69
- You wouldn't, it might break your cigars.
- What cigars?

70
- The ones you're smuggling in your cane.
- Cane?

71
You could be jailed for this.
You had no search warrant.

72
In hospital he'd hide cigars and brandy
all over the place.

73
We called him Wilfrid the fox.

74
- I'm confiscating these.
- Can't I have just one?

75
No. Upstairs.

76
A few puffs after meals? Please.

77
I'll do it. Some dark night when her back
is turned, I'll snatch her thermometer

78
and plunge it between
her shoulder blades. So help me, I will.

79
Oh, no, sir. You mustn't walk up. We've
installed something for you here. It's a lift.

80
A lift? I'm sick of this plot
to make me a helpless invalid.

81
I think it's a splendid idea.
Let's try it, shall we?

82
Out of there. I'll try it.
It's my lift because it was my heart attack.

83
Here you are. Simply press this button
for up and this one for down.

84
Carter, I warn you,
if this contraption should collapse,

85
if the barrister
should fall off the bannister...

86
Remarkable.
Smoothest flight I've had in years.

87
- Upsy-daisy!
- Once more to get the feel of the controls.

88
Good afternoon.
Is it possible to see Sir Wilfrid?

89
I didn't make an appointment,
but this is urgent.

90
If it's about a brief, I'm sorry, but we're
full. Sir Wilfrid has all that he can handle.

91
I'm sure he'll want this brief.

92
Serious criminal matter.

93
Absolutely not, Mr Mayhew.
Sir Wilfrid is still convalescent.

94
He can't accept anything
of an overstimulating nature.

95
Put me on a diet of bland civil suits.
Hello, Mayhew.

96
Hello. Distressing news about your health.

97
It's tragic. You'd better get
a man with younger arteries.

98
If you could just give us a few minutes.
This is Mr Leonard Vole.

99
- He's in rather a ghastly mess, I'm afraid.
- How do you do, Mr Vole?

100
Well, according to Mr Mayhew,
I'm not doing at all well.

101
Sir Wilfrid! Sir Wilfrid!

102
- You're dawdling again!
- Oh, shut up!

103
Sorry, Mayhew. Try me again when
you've something not too stimulating.

104
Like a postman bitten by a stray dog.

105
I wish you could help us, Wilfrid, but
I quite understand. Take care of yourself.

106
Mayhew! Mayhew!

107
Oh, no. Sir Wilfrid, please.

108
Don't worry, we won't take the brief,
but an old friend needs help.

109
Surely I can give him a word of advice.

110
Come on, I'll give you five minutes.
No, no, I don't want you, just Mayhew.

111
Our nap! Sir Wilfrid! Our nap!

112
You go ahead. Start it without me.

113
This is your fault.
You should not have permitted it.

114
It is not my fault. I distinctly told
Sir Wilfrid no criminal cases.

115
Well, if it's anyone's fault,
I expect it's mine.

116
Seems silly to me,
but Mr Mayhew thinks it's very urgent.

117
- He thinks I may be arrested any minute.
- Arrested for what?

118
Well, for murder.

119
Oh!

120
It's the case of Emily French.
You've probably seen reports in the press.

121
Middle-aged widow, well-off,
living with a housekeeper at Hampstead.

122
Mr Vole had been with her earlier.

123
When the housekeeper returned,
she found her dead,

124
struck on the back of the head
and killed.

125
Vole seems caught
in a web of circumstantial evidence.

126
Perhaps if I gave you the details you'd
suggest the strongest line of defence.

127
- I'd probably think better with a cigar.
- Of course.

128
No previous convictions. He's of good
character with an excellent war record.

129
- You'd like him a lot.
- They've confiscated the matches. A light.

130
The defence may turn on establishing
an alibi for the night of the murder.

131
- I haven't got any. Let me get you some.
- Lord, no! You don't know Miss Plimsoll.

132
This will take all our cunning.

133
Young man!

134
Come here, please.

135
Your solicitor and I feel you may be able
to enlighten me on an important point.

136
- Yes. Thank you.
- Sir Wilfrid!

137
You're not in bed yet? Upstairs!

138
- Give me a match.
- Sorry, I never carry them.

139
- What? You said I'd like him.
- But I do have a lighter.

140
You're quite right, Mayhew,
I do like him. Thank you.

141
Can you imagine Miss Plimsoll's face
if she saw me now?

142
Then let's make absolutely sure
that she doesn't.

143
Splendid. All the instincts
of a skilled criminal.

144
- Thank you, sir.
- Here.

145
Whether or not you murdered
a middle-aged widow,

146
you certainly saved the life
of an elderly barrister.

147
I haven't murdered anybody. It's absurd.

148
Christine, that's my wife, she thought
I may be implicated and needed a lawyer.

149
That's why I went to see Mr Mayhew.
Now he thinks he needs a lawyer

150
and now I have two lawyers.
It's rather silly.

151
I am a solicitor. Sir Wilfrid is a barrister.

152
Only a barrister can actually
plead a case in court.

153
- Oh, I see.
- She shall not even find the ashes.

154
- Sit down.
- Thank you.

155
I saw in the paper that Mrs French had
been found dead with her head bashed in.

156
It also said the police were anxious to
interview me since I visited that evening.

157
- Naturally, I went to the police station.
- Did they caution you?

158
I don't quite know.
They asked if I'd like to make a statement

159
and said they'd write it down and it might
be used against me. Is that a caution?

160
Well, it can't be helped now.

161
- They seemed quite satisfied.
- They seemed satisfied, Mr Vole.

162
He thinks that he made a statement
and that's the end of it. Isn't it obvious

163
that you will be regarded as the principal
suspect? I'm afraid you'll be arrested.

164
I've done nothing!
Why should I be arrested?

165
This is England! You don't get arrested
or convicted for crimes you haven't done.

166
We try not to make a habit of it.

167
But it does happen, though, doesn't it?

168
Of course. There was that case of
that fellow, whatshisname, Adolph Beck.

169
In jail for years and they
suddenly found it was another chap.

170
- He'd been innocent!
- Unfortunate, but restitution was made.

171
He received a pardon, a bounty from the
crown, and was restored to normal life.

172
That's all right for him. What if
it had been murder? What if he'd hanged?

173
How would they have restored him
to his normal life then?

174
Mr Vole, you must not take
such a morbid point of view.

175
It's just when you say these things
are closing in on me, it's like a nightmare.

176
Relax. You're in the hands of the finest,
most experienced barrister in London.

177
Let's get this straight. I may have done
something highly unethical.

178
I've taken your cigar
but I'm not taking your case. I can't.

179
I'm forbidden. My doctors would never
allow it. I'm truly sorry, young man.

180
But if you'd like the case
handled by these chambers,

181
- I'd recommend Mr Brogan-Moore.
- Yes. A very able man.

182
- I second Sir Wilfrid's recommendation.
- All right, sir, if you say so.

183
Hold this.

184
Carter?

185
I would like to see Brogan-Moore here
as soon as he comes in from court.

186
Sir Wilfrid, I have never
known such insubordination.

187
Not even as a nurse during the war.

188
What war was that?
The Crimean War, no doubt.

189
You'll like Brogan-Moore,
he's had excellent training. Under me.

190
This morning I had no lawyers at all
and now suddenly I have three.

191
We should explain
that I have very little money.

192
I shan't be able to pay
all the costs and fees.

193
We'll get a fourth lawyer to sue you.

194
He won't get very much.
I haven't had a job in four months.

195
- What sort of work do you do?
- Well, uh...

196
My last job was as a mechanic.
The foreman kept riding me all the time.

197
- I took it as long as I could, then I quit.
- And before that?

198
I worked in a department store, in toys,
demonstrating children's building sets.

199
Of course, it lasted only during Christmas.
Before that I tested electric blankets.

200
- Electric blankets?
- I suppose you think I'm a bit of a drifter.

201
It's true, in a way,
but I'm really not like that.

202
My army service unsettled me. That and
living abroad. I was stationed in Germany.

203
It was fine there, though.
That's where I met my wife.

204
She was an actress, and a good one.
She's a wonderful wife to me, too.

205
But I haven't been much of a provider,
I'm afraid.

206
Somehow, I just don't seem able to settle
down now I've come back to this country.

207
- If I could just put my eggbeater across.
- Eggbeater?

208
Yes, sir. I, uh, I'm a bit of an inventor.
Nothing big, just little household things.

209
Pocket pencil sharpeners,
key chain flashlights.

210
But my best is really this eggbeater.

211
It not only beats,
it also separates the yolk from the white.

212
Is that really desirable?

213
If you were a housewife,
you'd see it right away.

214
The trouble is, I need money
for manufacturing and promotion.

215
I was really hoping that's what Mrs
French might do for me after I met her.

216
- Exactly how did you meet Mrs French?
- That's rather funny in itself.

217
It was 3 September. I remember
because it's my wife's birthday.

218
I was window-shopping in Oxford Street,

219
daydreaming about what I'd buy for her,
if I had any money.

220
- You really like this one?
- Very much.

221
- You don't think it's too mad?
- Mad?

222
Not at all. Daring, perhaps. I wouldn't
recommend it to every woman. But you?

223
- Why shouldn't you attract attention?
- You think so?

224
Absolutely. But if I could
suggest one little thing.

225
Perhaps we could tip it and bring it back
a bit like that. Show more of your face.

226
- My bus. Goodbye.
- Good...

227
You buy that hat. I insist.

228
Actually, it was a ridiculous sort of hat -
a silly thing with ribbons and flowers.

229
I'm constantly surprised that women's
hats do not provoke more murders.

230
Go on, please.

231
I was only trying to be nice
to make her feel good.

232
I never dreamed I'd see her again.
Or the hat.

233
- But you did?
- Yes, a few weeks later.

234
Again, by accident. I was peddling my
eggbeaters and business was a little slow.

235
Would you mind, madam? Your hat.

236
- Oh, it's you!
- Hello!

237
It's your fault, you know.
You chose it yourself.

238
- May I?
- Sure, if you like.

239
Thank you. It's such a bother
taking it off and putting it back on again.

240
That chap is Jesse James. They've led
him into an ambush. It's not at all cricket.

241
- Don't worry, he shoots his way out.
- He does?

242
- I've seen it. I got to the movies a lot.
- You do?

243
I get restless so I go out. Then I find
I've no place to go so I go to the movies.

244
Sometimes I see the same one
two or three times. Ooh.

245
- Toffee?
- Oh, yes, please.

246
At this time you had no idea
that Mrs French was well-off?

247
No. Absolutely not.
We were sitting in the cheap seats.

248
All I knew was she seemed to be
very lonely, had no friends whatsoever.

249
She and her husband
lived abroad in British Nigeria.

250
He was in the colonial service.
He died in '45, of a heart attack.

251
Please, Mayhew, not when I'm smoking.
Go on, young man.

252
Well, they finally
polished off Jesse James,

253
and after we left the movie
she invited me to her house for tea.

254
I think it's the most fascinating thing
I've ever seen. Janet, come and look.

255
I've seen eggbeaters before, ma'am.

256
But this beats so quickly
and it separates too!

257
It must be cen-trifugal
or centrifugal, which is it?

258
It's specific gravity,
but it whips cream too.

259
Did you hear that, Janet?
It whips cream too.

260
We must have one. Is it expensive?

261
Compliments of the inventor,
manufacturer and sole distributor.

262
Thank you. We'll use it constantly,
won't we, Janet?

263
Come, we'd better get out of here.
Janet doesn't like visitors in her kitchen.

264
Ha!

265
It's a bit chilly in here, isn't it?
Shall we have a fire?

266
Why not?

267
This is a charming room.

268
Hubert and I collected all these things
when we lived in Africa.

269
Hubert was my husband.

270
Well, now, there's a loveable chap.

271
That's the mask of the witch doctor.

272
He wore it when he pulled
our servants' teeth.

273
So Hubert used to call him a witch dentist.

274
- Hubert was so witty.
- Yes, I can see that.

275
Oh, here's tea.

276
- Let's use our good silver and china.
- Oh, no, don't bother, Mrs French.

277
- This is perfectly all right.
- Lemon or milk, please?

278
- I don't really care.
- Would you prefer sherry?

279
- That'd be fine.
- We've no' got any.

280
Oh, but we have. There's that bottle,
the one we bought last Christmas.

281
If you care for an eggnog there's a wasted
egg in the kitchen ready and separated.

282
Do sit down. Don't mind Janet, Mr Vole.
It's just that she's terribly Scotch.

283
Oh, is she? I thought
she came with the collection.

284
You know, maybe
I'll take a glass of sherry myself.

285
I feel like Christmas, somehow.

286
After that I saw her once or twice a week.
She always kept a bottle of sherry for me.

287
We'd talk, play canasta,
listen to gramophone records,

288
Gilbert and Sullivan mostly.

289
It's so weird to think of her now,
lying in that living room, murdered.

290
I assure you she's been moved by now.
To leave her would be unfeeling, unlawful,

291
and unsanitary.

292
Tell Sir Wilfrid about
the evening of the murder.

293
I went around to see her
about eight o'clock.

294
She fixed a sandwich,
we talked, listened to The Mikado.

295
I left about nine. I walked home.
I got there about half past.

296
I can prove that. I can swear to it, in or out
of court, in the witness box, anywhere!

297
How much money did you get
from Mrs French?

298
- Nothing.
- The truth. How much?

299
- Why should she give me any money?
- Because she was in love with you.

300
That's ridiculous. She liked me.

301
She pampered me like an aunt.
But that's all, I swear.

302
- Why didn't you tell her you had a wife?
- I did!

303
But you never took your wife along
when you went there. Why not?

304
- Because...
- Because what?

305
Because she was under the impression
we didn't get along too well.

306
- Is that true?
- No! We love each other.

307
- Then how did she get that impression?
- She just seemed to want to believe it.

308
- You never corrected her. Why?
- I was afraid she'd lose interest.

309
Because she was rich,
and you were after her money.

310
Well, yes, in a way.

311
I was hoping for a loan for my new
invention. Just a few hundred pounds.

312
An honest business proposition, that's all.
Is that so wicked?

313
You knew it was
the housekeeper's day off?

314
- Well, yes.
- You went there because she'd be alone?

315
No, because I thought
she might be lonely.

316
All right, lonely. You and the rich
lonely widow all alone in that house

317
with a gramophone blaring The Mikado.

318
Perhaps you turned up
the volume to drown her cries.

319
- When I left her she was alive!
- When Janet came back she was dead.

320
The house had been ransacked! It said
in the papers. It must've been a burglar.

321
I didn't do it. No matter
how bad things look, I didn't do it!

322
You must believe me.
You do believe me, don't you?

323
I do now, but I wasn't sure.

324
That's why I subjected your eyes
and my arteries to that ordeal.

325
- I'm sorry.
- That's all right.

326
As for things looking bad, they
don't look bad, Mr Vole, they look terrible.

327
- Apparently you've no alibi at all.
- But I have. I left Mrs French's at nine.

328
- By bus or underground?
- No, I walked. It was a fine night.

329
- Did anyone see you?
- Christine saw me when I got home.

330
It was 9.26. I know because I went right to
work on a clock I've been tinkering with.

331
- My wife will tell you.
- Your wife loves you, yes?

332
Very much.
We're devoted to each other.

333
You realise, Mr Vole, the testimony of a
devoted wife does not carry much weight.

334
People might think
Christine would lie on my account?

335
It has been known, Mr Vole.
Blood is thicker than evidence.

336
- Ah, Brogan-Moore. Come in, come in.
- So good to have you out of hospital.

337
I didn't get a full pardon, I'm out on
parole. You know Mr Mayhew, I believe.

338
- This is his client, Mr Leonard Vole.
- How do you do?

339
- How do you do?
- The Emily French murder.

340
- Oh, how do you do?
- Badly, thank you.

341
A mass of circumstantial evidence.
No alibi whatsoever. It's a hot potato.

342
- Tossing it into your lap.
- Much obliged.

343
Your line of defence,
however, will be lack of motive.

344
You will agree that we can rule out
a crime of passion, hm?

345
That leaves us with a murder for profit.

346
If Mr Vole had been sponging off Mrs
French, why cut off the source of supply?

347
Or, if he'd been hoping for a golden egg,
why kill the goose before it was laid?

348
No motive. No motive whatsoever.

349
- You find some flaw in this reasoning?
- No, no, it's very sound as far as it goes.

350
Well, it's all yours. You'll find Mr Vole
very responsive and quite candid.

351
So candid, he's already told me
we'll have to sue him for our fees.

352
Oh, we'll simply put a lean
on Mr Vole's L80,000.

353
- What L80,000?
- The L80,000 Mrs French left you.

354
Left me?

355
They opened Mrs French's
bank vault today and found her will.

356
- Congratulations.
- L80,000!

357
And I was worried about a couple
of hundred for that silly eggbeater.

358
I must call Christine.

359
Oh.

360
This doesn't make things
look any better for me, does it?

361
- No. I wouldn't think so.
- So now they'll say I did have a motive.

362
They will indeed. L80,000 makes for
a very handsome motive.

363
I thought you were crazy
but now they will arrest me!

364
It's not unlikely.

365
As a matter of fact, it's quite likely.
They're on their way up now.

366
I knew nothing about that will. I'd no idea
she'd any intention of leaving me money.

367
- If I didn't know, how can it be a motive?
- We'll certainly bring that out in court.

368
- It's our old friend Inspector Hearne.
- Chief Inspector as of last month.

369
Chief Inspector? They must think
a lot of you at Scotland Yard.

370
You're getting the de luxe treatment.

371
- Oh, in here, Chief Inspector.
- Sorry to disturb you in your chambers.

372
That's perfectly all right.
I never object to the actions of the police

373
- except once in a great while in court.
- Yes, sir, I still have the scars.

374
You know Mr Mayhew, Mr Brogan-Moore.

375
This is Leonard Vole. You'd better search
him, he may be armed with an eggbeater.

376
- Is your name Leonard Vole?
- Yes, it is.

377
I have a warrant for your arrest
on the charge of murdering Emily French.

378
I must warn you that anything you say
may be taken down and used in evidence.

379
Well, I'm ready. Must I be handcuffed?

380
That won't be necessary, sir.

381
I've never been arrested before,
not even for walking a dog off a lead

382
- or having a beer after hours.
- There's no disgrace in being arrested.

383
Kings, prime ministers, archbishops,
even barristers have stood in the dock.

384
- Somebody better call my wife.
- I will, don't worry.

385
I'll go too, see you're properly charged.

386
- You will see to it that he is well-treated?
- We will.

387
Would you like a cigar? Pardon me.

388
- That's very kind of you, Sir Wilfrid.
- I'd better not. It would constitute a bribe.

389
We ought to be going, Mr Vole.

390
One thing I've learned for sure, never
look in a window with women's hats.

391
Good day, sir.

392
Makes a very nice impression,
doesn't he?

393
- Yes, rather. Give him the monocle test?
- Passed with flying colours.

394
I hope he does as well in the dock.
This is sticky, you know.

395
Of course. The prosecution will
blast in with their heaviest artillery.

396
All you'll have is one little popgun,
an alibi furnished by his wife.

397
Isn't that an intriguing challenge?

398
I think I'd like it more if it was less
of a challenge and less intriguing.

399
Miss Plimsoll has issued an ultimatum.
In bed in one minute or she'll resign.

400
Splendid. Give her a month's pay
and kick her down the stairs.

401
Either you take care of yourself
or I, too, shall resign.

402
This is blackmail.
But you're quite right.

403
For my first day this has already
been rather hectic. I should be in bed.

404
I'd better get in touch with Mrs Vole
and have her come over. Will you sit in?

405
Thank you, no. I'm in no condition to cope
with emotional wives drenched in tears.

406
Miss Plimsoll, how alluring you look,
waiting like a hangman on the scaffold.

407
Take me, I'm yours.

408
Oh!

409
About Mrs Vole. Handle her gently,
especially when you tell her of the arrest.

410
Bear in mind she's a foreigner, so prepare
for hysterics, even a fainting spell.

411
Better have smelling salts ready,
box of tissues and a nip of brandy.

412
I do not think
that will be necessary.

413
I never faint in case I don't fall gracefully,

414
and I never use smelling salts
because they puff up the eyes.

415
I'm Christine Vole.

416
How do you do?
This is Mr Brogan-Moore.

417
How do you do?

418
- I am Wilfrid Robarts.
- How do you do?

419
My dear Mrs Vole, I'm afraid
we have bad news for you.

420
- Don't be afraid, I'm quite disciplined.
- There's nothing to be alarmed about yet.

421
Leonard has been arrested
and charged with murder. Is that it?

422
- Yes.
- I knew he would be, I told him so.

423
I'm glad you're showing such fortitude.

424
Call it what you like.
What is the next step?

425
Your husband will have
to stand trial, I'm afraid.

426
Will you explain the procedure?
Mr Brogan-Moore will lead the defence.

427
Oh?

428
- You will not defend Leonard?
- Regrettably not.

429
My health, or, rather,
the lack of it, forbids me.

430
It is regrettable. Mr Mayhew described
you as champion of the hopeless cause.

431
Is it, perhaps,
that this cause is too hopeless?

432
I'll have a serious talk with Dr Harrison. It
was a mistake to let you come back here.

433
I should have taken you
to a rest-home or a resort.

434
Some place quiet, far off, like Bermuda.

435
Shut up. You just want
to see me in those nasty shorts.

436
Come now, Sir Wilfrid,
you must not think of it.

437
You must get ready for sleep,
think beautiful thoughts.

438
Now, let's get undressed. Put these on,
tops and bottoms, while I make your bed.

439
After your rest
we'll have a nice cup of cocoa.

440
Then perhaps
we'll have a walk around the square.

441
You know, I feel sorry
for that nice Mr Vole.

442
And not just because he was arrested,
but that wife of his. She must be German.

443
That's what happens when we let our
boys cross the Channel. They go crazy.

444
The government should do something
about foreign wives. Like an embargo.

445
How else can we take care of our own
surplus. Don't you agree, Sir Wilfrid?

446
All right. Hop in!

447
Sir Wilfrid?

448
Sir Wilfrid!

449
Come back!

450
Yes, of course I knew that Leonard had
been seeing Mrs French quite frequently.

451
Go on.

452
I knew when he came home with a pair
of green socks she'd knitted for him.

453
That's quite natural.
I'm sure a jury will find it endearing.

454
Leonard can be very endearing.
He hates that particular shade of green

455
and the socks were two sizes too large,

456
but he wore them just the same
to give her pleasure.

457
Leonard has a way with women.

458
I only hope he has an all-woman jury.
They will carry him from court in triumph.

459
A simple acquittal will do. Now, you know
Mrs French left your husband money?

460
Yes. A lot of money.

461
Of course, your husband had
no previous knowledge of this bequest?

462
Is that what he told you?

463
Surely you're not suggesting different?

464
Oh, no, no. I do not suggest anything.

465
Clearly, she had come to look upon your
husband as a son or favourite nephew.

466
You think Mrs French looked
upon Leonard as a son? Or a nephew?

467
I do. An entirely natural
and understandable relationship.

468
What hypocrites you are in this country.

469
Pardon me, Brogan-Moore.

470
- Do you mind if I ask you a question?
- Go right ahead, Sir Wilfrid.

471
You realise your husband's entire
defence rests on his word and yours?

472
- I realise that.
- And that the jury will be quite sceptical

473
of the word of a man accused of murder
when supported only by that of his wife?

474
- I realise that too.
- Let us, then, at least make sure

475
- the two are not in conflict.
- By all means, let's.

476
I assume you want to help your husband?

477
Of course I want to help Leonard. I want
to help Mr Brogan-Moore and to help you.

478
There. Isn't that
more comfortable for you?

479
Now, Mrs Vole. This is very important.

480
On the night of the murder your husband
came home before 9.30. Correct?

481
Precisely. Isn't that
what he wants me to say?

482
Isn't it the truth?

483
Of course.

484
But when I told the police,
I do not think they believed me.

485
Maybe I didn't say it well.
Maybe because of my accent.

486
My dear Mrs Vole, in our courts

487
we accept the evidence
of witnesses who speak only Bulgarian

488
and who must have an interpreter.

489
We accept the evidence
of deaf-mutes who cannot speak at all,

490
as long as they tell the truth.

491
You're aware that when you're
in the witness box you will be sworn

492
- and you will testify under oath?
- Yes.

493
Leonard came home at 9.26 precisely
and did not go out again.

494
The truth, the whole truth
and nothing but the truth. Is that better?

495
- Mrs Vole, do you love your husband?
- Leonard thinks I do.

496
- Well, do you?
- Am I already under oath?

497
Whatever your gambit may be,
do you know that, under British law,

498
you cannot be called to give testimony
damaging to your husband?

499
How very convenient.

500
We are dealing with a capital crime.

501
The prosecution
will try to hang your husband.

502
He is not my husband.

503
Leonard and I went through
a form of marriage,

504
but I had a husband living somewhere
in East Germany, in the Russian zone.

505
- Did you tell Leonard?
- I did not. It would have been stupid.

506
He would not have married me and
I'd have been left to starve in the rubble.

507
But he did marry you
and brought you safely here.

508
Don't you think you should be grateful?

509
One can get very tired of gratitude.

510
Your husband loves you
very much, does he not?

511
Leonard?
He worships the ground I walk on.

512
And you?

513
You want to know too much.

514
Auf Wiedersehen, gentlemen.

515
Thank you for coming in, Mrs Vole.
Your visit has been most reassuring.

516
Do not worry, Sir Wilfrid. I will give him
an alibi and I shall be very convincing.

517
There will be tears in my eyes when I say
"Leonard came home at 9.26 precisely. "

518
You're a very remarkable woman,
Mrs Vole.

519
And you're satisfied, I hope?

520
- I'm damned if I'm satisfied!
- Care for a whiff of those smelling salts?

521
That woman's up to something. But what?

522
The prosecution will break her down
in no time when she's in the witness box.

523
This case is going to be rather
like the charge of the Light Brigade

524
or one of those Japanese suicide pilots.
Quite one-sided.

525
With the odds all on the other side.

526
I haven't got much to go on, have I?

527
The fact is, I've got nothing.

528
Let me ask you something.

529
Do you believe Leonard Vole is innocent?

530
Do you?

531
Do you?

532
I'm not sure.

533
Oh, I'm sorry, Wilfrid.
Of course, I'll do my best.

534
It's all right, Brogan-Moore.

535
I'll take it from here.

536
I have called Dr Harrison and given him
a report on your shocking behaviour.

537
- Give me a match, Miss Plimsoll.
- Sir Wilfrid!

538
Did you hear me? A match!

539
Mr Mayhew. Sir Wilfrid. I'm told you are
going to represent me. I'm very grateful.

540
I struck a bargain with my doctors. They
exile me to Bermuda as soon as we finish.

541
- Thank you.
- There's hope that we'll both survive.

542
- Get into these. We need a photograph.
- Why?

543
This is what you were wearing that night.

544
We'll circulate a photo on the chance
that someone saw you on your way home.

545
Over here against the wall, please.

546
Hold it.
One more in profile, please.

547
Do we really need this? My wife knows
what time I came home that night.

548
A disinterested witness
may be of more value.

549
Yes, of course,
Christine is an interested witness.

550
I'll pick up the negatives later. Thank you.

551
I don't understand it.
Why hasn't she come to see me?

552
Won't they let her see me?
I mean, it's been two weeks now.

553
Mayhew, give me the reports.

554
Have you been talking to her?
Is there something the matter?

555
I want to read a portion of the evidence
of Janet McKenzie, the housekeeper.

556
"Mr Vole helped Mrs French
with her business affairs,

557
particularly her income tax returns. "

558
Oh, yes, I did. Some of those forms
are very complicated.

559
There's also a hint you may
have helped her draft her new will.

560
Well, that's not true!
If Janet said that she's lying.

561
She was always against me,
I don't know why!

562
It's obvious. You threw an eggbeater into
the wheels of her Victorian household.

563
Now, this cut in your wrist.
You say you cut yourself with a knife?

564
Well, that's true, I did.
I was cutting bread and the knife slipped.

565
But that was two days after. Christine
was there. She'll tell them in her evidence.

566
Are you keeping something from me?
Is she ill? Was she shocked?

567
All things considered, she took it well.
Though that may be only on the surface.

568
Wives are often profoundly
disturbed at such a time.

569
Yes, it must be hard.
We've never been separated before.

570
- Not since our first meeting.
- How did you meet your wife, Mr Vole?

571
In Germany in 1945.

572
It's rather funny. The very first time
I saw her, the ceiling fell right in on me.

573
I was stationed outside Hamburg,
with an RAF maintenance unit.

574
I'd just installed a shower in the officers'
billet, so they gave me a weekend pass.

575
Come on!

576
D Join the party

577
d Have a hearty glass of rum

578
d Don't ever think about tomorrow

579
d For tomorrow may never come

580
d When I find me a happy place

581
d That's where I wanna stay

582
d Time is nothing
as long as I'm living it up this way

583
d I may never go home any more

584
d Dim the lights
and start locking the door

585
d Give your arms to me
Give your charms to me

586
d After all that's what sailors are for

587
d I've got kisses and kisses galore

588
d That have never been tasted before

589
d If you treat me right
This could be the night

590
d I may never go home

591
d I may never go home

592
d I may never go home

593
d I may never go home

594

595
d I may never go home any more

596
Hey, Fr遧ein, show us some legs.


597
They rob you blind
and then throw you a ruddy sailor!

598
- Come on, let's see 'em.
- We want legs!

599
Come help the cabaret out of her trousers!

600
All right, Fr遧ein,

if you won't show 'em, I will.

601
All right, outside, everybody.
Come on, let's go.

602
Come on.

603
Bring him round to the other truck.

604
We'll be back, baby! We'll be back!

605
Gesundheit.

606
- What are you looking for?
- My accordion.

607
Oh, let me help you.

608
- I think I found it.
- Step on it again, it's still breathing.

609
I'm terribly sorry.

610
You better go. We've had trouble enough.

611
Well, it's your own fault. That costume
in the picture gave the boys ideas

612
- then those trousers let them down hard.
- That costume went in the first raid.

613
Then raid by raid, my other dresses,
and now you've bombed my trousers.

614
Cigarette? Gum?

615
You're burning my nose.

616
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- That's all right.

617
How about a cup of coffee?
I've got a tin of coffee.

618
How much?

619
I don't know.
What's the rate of exchange?

620
- Depends whether it's fresh or powdered.
- It's instant coffee.

621
Got any hot water at your place?

622
- Sometimes.
- Let's take a chance. Where do you live?

623
Nearby.

624
Come.

625
Sorry, it's the maid's night off.

626
This is pretty horrible.
In a gem鱨ich sort of way.


627
Oh, it's fine now.
I used to have a roommate. A dancer.

628
She had luck, she married a Canadian.
She now lives in Toronto.

629
She has a Ford automobile.

630
Make yourself comfortable,
the stove is slow these days.

631
That's all right, I've got a weekend pass.

632
No, not that chair. It holds up the
beam and that holds up the ceiling.

633
You'd better sit down on the cot.

634
The cot?

635
Getting more gem鱨ich all the time.

Are you married?

636
- Why?
- Well, the, um...

637
Oh, that. No, no, I'm not married.

638
I just wear it when I'm working.
Gives a little protection with all the men.

639
- Didn't work too well tonight, did it?
- No, tonight was bad.

640
But it's getting better.

641
- Where's the coffee?
- Ah, coffee, ja voll.

642
Finest Brazilian blend. The same brand
that Field Marshal Montgomery drinks.

643
Is that a fair rate of exchange?

644
Very fair.

645
Would you be interested
in having the whole tin?

646
I would.

647
- How are you fixed for sugar?
- I could use some.

648
Milk?

649
Sure.

650
Milk. Sugar.

651
It's a pleasure to do business with you.

652
Yeah.

653
I also carry biscuits, powdered eggs,

654
- bacon, marmalade.
- I don't know if I can afford it.

655
Don't worry, we'll work out something,
like an instalment plan.

656
D I may never go home any more

657
I'm terribly sorry.
Now you have no ceiling.

658
- Maybe I can fix it, I'm good at it.
- Why fix it? It's not raining.

659
Ooh.

660
- Are you all right?
- I think so. My head aches a little.

661
Maybe I can fix it.

662
I'm good at it.

663
I had a weekend pass,
a month's pay in my pocket.

664
- And she already had a wedding ring.
- Yes, that's right.

665
We got married. When I got out
of the service I brought her here.

666
It was wonderful.
I rented a little flat, Edgware Road.

667
First time she saw it, she was so happy
she broke down and cried.

668
Naturally. She had a solid roof
over her head and a British passport.

669
You don't know her, how she feels about
me. You will when she gives evidence.

670
Mr Vole, I must tell you
I am not putting her in the witness box.

671
You're not? Why not?

672
She's a foreigner, unfamiliar
with the subtleties of our language.

673
The prosecution could easily trip her up.

674
I hear it may be Mr Myers for the crown.
We can't take chances.

675
Quite. We'd better be going. Miss Plimsoll
is waiting in the car with her pills

676
- and a Thermos of lukewarm cocoa.
- Officer.

677
- But Christine must give evidence.
- Mr Vole, you must learn to trust me.

678
For no other reason than I'm a mean,
ill-tempered old man who hates to lose.

679
Let us wish each other luck.

680
Look, I can't face this without Christine.
I tell you, I need her. Without her I'm sunk.

681
Touching, isn't it?
The way he counts on his wife.

682
Yes. Like a drowning man
clutching at a razor blade.

683
Leonard Stephen Vole, you are
charged on indictment for that you,

684
on the 14th day of October,
in the county of London,

685
murdered Emily Jane French.

686
How say you, Leonard Stephen Vole?

687
Are you guilty or not guilty?

688
Not guilty.

689
Members of the jury,

690
the prisoner stands indicted for that he,
on the 14th day of October,

691
murdered Emily Jane French.

692
To this indictment
he has pleaded not guilty.

693
And it is your charge to say,
having heard the evidence,

694
whether he be guilty or not.

695
Members of the jury,
by the oath which you have just taken,

696
you have sworn
to try this case on the evidence.

697
You must shut out
from your minds everything

698
except what will take place in this court.

699
You may proceed
for the prosecution, Mr Myers.

700
May it please you, my lord.
Members of the jury,

701
I appear in this case with my learned
friend, Mr Barton, for the prosecution.

702
And my learned friends
Sir Wilfrid Robarts and Mr Brogan-Moore

703
appear for the defence.

704
I trust we are not to be deprived

705
of the learned and stimulating
presence of Sir Wilfrid?

706
My lord, may I assure my learned friend
that Sir Wilfrid is in the Old Bailey.

707
He's slightly incapacitated,
but will be in his seat presently.

708
My lord, may I express my regret that
Sir Wilfrid is even slightly incapacitated.

709
You may, Mr Myers. You may also
proceed with the case for the prosecution.

710
Thank you, my lord.

711
The facts in this case are simple
and, to a point, not in dispute.

712
You will hear how the prisoner made
the acquaintance of Mrs Emily French,

713
a woman of 56.

714
How he was treated by her
with kindness and even affection.

715
On the night of October 14 last,

716
between 9.30 and 10,
Mrs French was murdered.

717
Medical testimony
will be introduced to prove

718
that death was caused by a blow
from a blunt and heavy instrument,

719
and it is the case for the prosecution

720
that the blow was dealt
by the prisoner, Leonard Vole.

721
That's not true! I didn't do it!

722
Among the witnesses,
you will hear police evidence,

723
also the evidence of Mrs French's
housekeeper, Janet McKenzie,

724
and from the medical
and laboratory experts,

725
and the evidence of the murdered
woman's solicitor, who drew her final will.

726
I now call Chief Inspector Hearne,
Criminal Investigation Department,

727
- New Scotland Yard.
- Chief Inspector Hearne.

728
- Chief Inspector Hearne.
- Chief Inspector Hearne.

729
This is ridiculous. Just nervous heartburn.
I always get it the first day of a trial.

730
240 above 130.
You shouldn't be here at all.

731
- I should be in court, the trial's begun.
- Syringe, please.

732
Be a good, brave boy, Sir Wilfrid.

733
It may interest you to know
that I am descended from a warrior family

734
which traces its brave past
back to Richard the Lion-Hearted.

735
You're to have a calcium injection daily,

736
- tranquillising pill every hour.
- I'll set my wristwatch alarm.

737
Any pain or shortness of breath,
pop one of these nitroglycerin tablets

738
under your tongue.
Oh, and I'll leave you some...

739
That's enough, Doctor.
The judge will be asking for a saliva test.

740
Carter, I'd better take
that Thermos of cocoa with me.

741
- Helps me wash down the pills.
- Let me see it, please.

742
My learned patient is not above
substituting brandy for cocoa.

743
It is cocoa. So sorry.

744
If you were a woman, Miss Plimsoll,
I would strike you.

745
Take care of this, Carter.

746
Now, Sir Wilfrid, in the courtroom,
you must avoid overexcitement.

747
Yes, Doctor, yes, yes.

748
Watch your temper.
Keep your blood pressure down.

749
Thank you, Doctor, I shall be quite safe,
what with the pills and the cocoa.

750
Come along, Carter.

751
From the body temperature
and other factors,

752
we placed the time of death
at between 9.30 and 10pm,

753
approximately 30 minutes before Janet
McKenzie returned home and called us.

754
Death was instantaneous, caused by one
blow from a heavy and blunt instrument.

755
Were there any signs of a struggle?

756
None. Just the one blow.

757
Would that indicate that the murderer
had taken Mrs French by surprise?

758
My lord, I must object.

759
My learned friend refers
to the assailant as "the murderer".

760
We have not yet determined whether
the assailant was a man or a woman.

761
It could quite conceivably
have been "the murderess".

762
Mr Myers, Sir Wilfrid has joined us just in
time to catch you on a point of grammar.

763
Please rephrase your question.

764
Yes, my lord. Inspector,
is it your opinion that the assailant,

765
whether he, she or it,
had taken Mrs French by surprise?

766
My lord, I am taken by surprise

767
that my learned friend should try to solicit
from the witness an opinion, not a fact.

768
Quite so. You'll have
to do better than that, Mr Myers.

769
My lord, I withdraw the question entirely.

770
- Is that better?
- That's much better.

771
Silence! Silence!

772
Very well, Inspector,
let us proceed with the facts.

773
After establishing the cause and the time
of death, what did you then do?

774
A search was made, photographs were
taken and the premises fingerprinted.

775
- What fingerprints did you discover?
- I found the fingerprints of Mrs French,

776
those of Janet McKenzie, and some which
later proved to be those of Leonard Vole.

777
- No others?
- No others.

778
Did you say the room had the appearance
that a robbery had been committed?

779
Yes. Things were strewn about and the
window had been broken near the catch.

780
There was glass on the floor,
and fragments were found outside.

781
The glass outside was not consistent with
the window being forced from the outside.

782
You're saying that someone made it look
as if it had been forced from the outside?

783
My lord, I must object. My learned friend
is putting words in the witness' mouth.

784
After all, if he insists
on answering his own questions,

785
the presence of the witness
would seem superfluous.

786
Quite. Don't you think so, Mr Myers?

787
Yes, my lord.

788
Inspector,

789
did you ascertain if any of the murdered
woman's property was missing?

790
According to the housekeeper,
nothing was missing.

791
In your experience, Inspector,
when burglars or burglaresses

792
break into a house,
do they leave without taking anything?

793
No, sir.

794
- Do you produce a jacket, Inspector?
- Yes, sir.

795
Is that the jacket?

796
- Yes, sir.
- That is exhibit P1, my lord.

797
Where did you find this, Inspector?

798
That is the jacket
found in the prisoner's flat,

799
which I handed to our lab
to test for bloodstains.

800
- And did you find any bloodstains?
- Yes.

801
Though an attempt
had been made to wash them out.

802
What tests were made?

803
First to determine
if the stains were human blood,

804
then to classify it by group or type.

805
And was the blood
of a particular group or type?

806
Yes, sir. It is type O.

807
And did you subsequently
test the blood of the dead woman?

808
- Yes, sir.
- What type was that?

809
The same. Type O.

810
Thank you, Inspector.
No further questions.

811
Inspector, you say the only fingerprints
you found were those of Mrs French,

812
Janet McKenzie and Leonard Vole.

813
In your experience, when a burglar breaks
in, does he usually leave fingerprints

814
- or does he wear gloves?
- He wears gloves.

815
So the absence
of fingerprints in a robbery

816
- would hardly surprise you?
- No, sir.

817
Can't we surmise the burglar might have
entered a presumably empty house,

818
suddenly encountered
Mrs French and struck her,

819
then, realising she was dead,
fled without taking anything?

820
I submit, my lord,
that it is entirely impossible

821
to guess what went on in the mind
of some entirely imaginary burglar.

822
With or without gloves.

823
Let us not surmise, Sir Wilfrid,
but confine ourselves to facts.

824
Inspector, when you questioned
the prisoner as to the stains on his jacket,

825
did he not show you
a recently-healed scar on his wrist,

826
- saying he had cut himself slicing bread?
- Yes, sir, that is what he said.

827
And were you not told
the same thing by his wife?

828
- Yes, sir. But afterwards...
- Just a simple yes or no, please.

829
Did the prisoner's wife show you a knife

830
and tell you that her husband
had cut his wrist while slicing bread?

831
- Yes, sir.
- I will ask you to examine this knife.

832
Just test the edge of it
with your finger. Carefully!

833
You agree that the point
and the cutting edge are razor-sharp?

834
- Yes, sir.
- Now, if such a knife were to slip,

835
might it not inflict a cut
that would bleed profusely?

836
Yes, sir, it might.

837
Inspector, you stated that the bloodstains
on the prisoner's jacket were analysed,

838
as was the blood of Mrs French, and
they were both found to be of group O.

839
- That is correct.
- However,

840
if the prisoner's blood
were also of this same group,

841
then the stains on his jacket
may well have resulted

842
from the household accident
he described to you.

843
Yes, sir.

844
Did you examine
the prisoner's blood, Inspector?

845
No, sir.

846
I have here a certificate

847
stating that Leonard Stephen Vole
is a blood donor

848
at the North London Hospital.

849
And that his blood is group O.

850
Thank you, Inspector.

851
Inspector, granted that the cut
on the wrist was caused by that knife,

852
is there anything to show
whether it was an accident

853
or done deliberately after the murder
to account for the bloodstains?

854
- Oh, really, my lord!
- I withdraw the question.

855
You may stand down.

856
- Call Janet McKenzie.
- Janet McKenzie.

857
- Janet McKenzie.
- Janet McKenzie.

858
I swear by Almighty God
that the evidence...

859
...the truth, the whole truth
and nothing but the truth.

860
Carter. Carter. Pill. Pill.

861
- Your name is Janet McKenzie?
- Aye, that's my name.

862
- When did you first come to London?
- That was many years ago. 28 years ago.

863
- Where do you live?
- Now that Mrs French, poor soul, is dead,

864
I've moved in with my niece
at 19 Glenister Road.

865
You were companion-housekeeper
to the late Mrs Emily French?

866
I was her housekeeper!
I've no opinion of companions,

867
poor feckless bodies, afraid
of a bit of honest domestic work.

868
I meant you were on friendly terms, not
altogether those of mistress and servant.

869
Aye. Ten years I was with her
and looked after her.

870
She knew me and she trusted me.

871
Many's the time
I prevented her doing a foolish thing.

872
Please tell us, in your own words, about
the events of the evening of October 14.

873
It was a Friday and my night out. I was
going to see my niece at Glenister Road,

874
which is about five minutes' walk.
I left the house at half past seven.

875
I promised to take her
a dress pattern that she admired.

876
- Och, is this thing necessary?
- An excellent question.

877
However, it has been installed at
considerable expense to the taxpayers,

878
so let us take advantage of it.
Please continue.

879
Well, when I got to my niece's,
I found I'd left the pattern behind.

880
So after supper I slipped
back to get it as it was no distance.

881
I got back to the house at 25 past 9.

882
I let myself in
and went upstairs to my room.

883
As I passed the sitting room, I heard the
prisoner in there, talking to Mrs French.

884
No, it wasn't me! It wasn't my voice!

885
Talking and laughing they were.

886
But it was no business of mine,
so I went upstairs to fetch my pattern.

887
Now, let us be very exact as to the time.

888
You say that you
re-entered the house at 25 past 9?

889
Aye. The pattern was on a shelf in my
room next to my clock so I saw the time.

890
- And it was 25 past 9.
- Go on, please.

891
I went back to my niece. Och,
she was delighted with the pattern. Si...

892
Simply delighted. I stayed until 20 to 11,
then I said good night and I come home.

893
I went into the sitting room to see
if the mistress wanted anything

894
before she went to bed.

895
And there she was, dead.
And everything tossed hither and thither.

896
Did you really think
that a burglary had been committed?

897
My lord, I must protest!

898
I will not allow that question
to be answered, Mr Myers.

899
Miss McKenzie, were you aware
that Leonard Vole was a married man?

900
No, indeed.
And neither was the mistress.

901
- Janet!
- My lord, I must object.

902
What Mrs French knew or did not know is
pure conjecture on Janet McKenzie's part.

903
Let me put it this way.
You formed the opinion

904
that Mrs French thought
Leonard Vole was a single man?

905
- Have you any facts to support this?
- The books that she ordered.

906
A life of the Baroness Burdett-Coutts,
and the one about Disraeli and his wife.

907
Both of them about women that married
men years younger than themselves. Oh!

908
- I knew what she was thinking.
- I'm afraid we cannot admit that.

909
Why?

910
Members of the jury, it is possible
for a woman to read The Life of Disraeli

911
without contemplating marriage
with a man younger than herself.

912
Were you aware of the arrangements Mrs
French made to dispose of her money?

913
She had her old will revoked
and a new one drawn up.

914
I heard her calling Mr Stokes,
her solicitor.

915
He was there at the time.
The prisoner, I mean.

916
You heard Mrs French
and the prisoner discussing her new will?

917
Yes. He was to have all her money,
she told him,

918
as she had no near relations nor anybody
that meant to her what he did.

919
- When did this take place?
- On October 8.

920
One week to the day
before she was murdered.

921
Thank you.
That concludes my examination.

922
Not just yet, Miss McKenzie.

923
Would you...? Thank you.

924
Miss McKenzie, you have
given evidence about two wills.

925
In the old will, that which was revoked,

926
were you not to receive
the bulk of Mrs French's estate?

927
That's so.

928
Whereas in the new will, except for
a bequest to you of a small annuity,

929
the principal beneficiary
is the prisoner, Leonard Vole.

930
It'll be a wicked injustice
if he ever touches a penny of that money.

931
It is entirely understandable
that you are antagonistic to the prisoner.

932
I'm not antagonistic to him.

933
He's a shiftless, scheming rascal.
But I'm not antagonistic to him.

934
I suggest you formed this opinion

935
because his friendship with Mrs French
cost you the bulk of her estate.

936
- I've never liked him.
- Your candour is refreshing.

937
Now. On the night of October 14

938
you say you heard the prisoner
and Mrs French talking together.

939
- What did you hear them say?
- I didn't hear what they actually said.

940
You mean you only heard the voices?

941
- The murmur of voices?
- They were laughing.

942
What makes you say
the man's voice was Leonard Vole's?

943
- I know his voice well enough.
- The door was closed, was it not?

944
- Aye, that's so.
- You were in a hurry to get the pattern

945
so you probably walked
quickly past the closed door,

946
yet you are sure
you heard Leonard Vole's voice?

947
I was there long enough
to hear what I heard.

948
Come, I'm sure you don't wish to suggest
to the jury that you were eavesdropping.

949
It was him in there.
Who else could it have been?

950
What you mean is that you wanted it to
be him. That's the way your mind worked.

951
Now, tell me, did Mrs French sometimes
watch television in the evening?

952
Yes. She was fond
of a talk or a good play.

953
Wasn't it possible when you
returned home and passed the door,

954
what you really heard was the television

955
and a man and woman's
voices and laughter?

956
There was a play called Lover's Leap
on the television that night.

957
- It was not the television.
- Oh, why not?

958
Because the television was away
being repaired that week, that's why.

959
Silence! Silence!

960
Odd. It's not time yet.

961
If my learned friend has no further
questions, I'd like...

962
I have not quite finished.

963
You are registered, are you not,
under the National Health Insurance Act?

964
Aye, that's so.
Four and sixpence I pay out every week.

965
That's a terrible lot of money
for a working woman to pay.

966
I am sure that many agree with you.

967
Miss McKenzie, did you recently apply
to the National Health Insurance for...

968
- ... a hearing aid?
- For... for what?

969
I protest against the way
in which this question was put!

970
I will repeat the question, my lord.

971
I asked you in a normal tone of voice,
audible to everyone in open court,

972
did you apply to the National Health
Insurance for a hearing aid?

973
Yes, I did.

974
- Did you get it?
- Not yet.

975
However, you state that you walked past
a door, which is four inches of solid oak,

976
you heard voices,
and you are willing to swear

977
that you could distinguish the voice of...

978
...the prisoner, Leonard Vole.

979
Who? Who?

980
No further questions.

981
Och, maybe you could help me,
Your Lordship.

982
Six months ago I applied for
my hearing aid, and I'm still waiting for it.

983
My dear Miss McKenzie, considering
the rubbish that is being talked nowadays,

984
you are missing very little.
You may stand down now.

985
Call Police Constable Jeffries.

986
- Police Constable Jeffries.
- Police Constable Jeffries.

987
I swear by Almighty God
that the evidence I shall give

988
shall be the truth, the whole truth
and nothing but the truth.

989
Mr Myers, does that conclude your case?

990
No, my lord. I now call the final witness
for the prosecution, Christine Helm.

991
- Christine Helm!
- Christine Helm.

992
Christine.

993
I swear by Almighty God
that the evidence I shall give

994
shall be the truth, the whole truth
and nothing but the truth.

995
My lord, I have the most serious objection

996
to this witness being summoned,
as she is the wife of the prisoner.

997
I call my learned friend's attention

998
to the fact that I summoned
not Mrs Vole, but Mrs Helm.

999
- Your name, in fact, is Christine Helm?
- Yes. Christine Helm.

1000
And you have been living
as the wife of the prisoner, Leonard Vole?

1001
- Yes.
- Are you actually his wife?

1002
No.

1003
I went through a marriage ceremony
with him, but I already had a husband.

1004
- He's still alive.
- Christine, that's not true!

1005
There is proof of a marriage
between the witness and the prisoner,

1006
but is there any proof
of a so-called previous marriage?

1007
My lord, the so-called previous marriage
is, in fact, well-documented.

1008
Mrs Helm, is this a certificate of marriage
between yourself and Otto Ludwig Helm,

1009
the ceremony having taken place
in Breslau on 18 April 1942?

1010
Yes, that is the paper of my marriage.

1011
I don't see any reason why this witness
should not be qualified to give evidence.

1012
You're willing to give evidence against the
man you've been calling your husband?

1013
Yes.

1014
You stated to the police that on the night
that Mrs French was murdered,

1015
Leonard Vole left the house at 7.30
and returned at 25 minutes past 9.

1016
Did he, in fact, return at 25 past 9?

1017
No. He returned at ten minutes past ten.

1018
Christine, what are you saying?
It's not true. You know it's not true!

1019
Silence!

1020
I must have silence.

1021
As your counsel will tell you,
Vole, you will very shortly

1022
have an opportunity of
speaking in your own defence.

1023
Leonard Vole returned, you say,
at ten minutes past ten.

1024
- And what happened next?
- He was breathing hard, very excited.

1025
He threw off his coat
and examined the sleeves.

1026
Then he told me to wash the cuffs.

1027
- They had blood on them.
- Go on.

1028
- I said "What have you done?"
- What did the prisoner say?

1029
He said "I've killed her. "

1030
Christine! Why are you lying?
Why are you saying these things?

1031
- What an awful woman.
- She's evil. I've known it all along.

1032
If the defence so desires,
I will adjourn for a short time

1033
so that the prisoner
may gain control of himself.

1034
My lord is most gracious,
but pray let the witness continue.

1035
We are all of us caught up
in the suspense of this horror fiction.

1036
To have to hear it in instalments
might prove unendurable.

1037
- Proceed, Mr Myers.
- Mrs Helm,

1038
when the prisoner said "I have killed her",
did you know to whom he referred?

1039
It was that woman
he had been seeing so often.

1040
When questioned by the police, you told
them that the prisoner returned at 9.25.

1041
Yes. Because Leonard
asked me to say that.

1042
But you've changed your story now. Why?

1043
I cannot go on lying to save him.

1044
I said to the police what he wanted
because I'm grateful to him.

1045
He married me
and brought me to this country.

1046
What he has asked me to do I have
because I was grateful.

1047
It was not because
he was your husband and you loved him?

1048
I never loved him.

1049
It was gratitude, then,
that prompted you to give him an alibi

1050
- in your statement to the police?
- That is it. Exactly.

1051
- But now you think it was wrong to do so.
- Because it is murder.

1052
That woman, she was a harmless old fool,

1053
and he makes of me
an accomplice to the murder.

1054
I cannot come into court and swear that
he was with me at the time it was done.

1055
I cannot do it! I cannot do it!

1056
Then this is the truth?

1057
That Leonard Vole returned
that night at ten minutes past ten,

1058
he had blood on the sleeves of his coat,

1059
and that he said to you
"I have killed her"?

1060
That is the truth.

1061
That is the truth, before God?

1062
That is the truth.

1063
Thank you.

1064
Mrs Vole, or Mrs Helm,
which do you prefer to be called?

1065
- It does not matter.
- Does it not?

1066
In this country we are inclined to take
a rather more serious view of marriage.

1067
However, it would appear that when
you first met the prisoner in Hamburg

1068
- you lied to him about your marital status.
- I wanted to get out of Germany, so...

1069
You lied, did you not?
Just yes or no, please.

1070
- Yes.
- Thank you.

1071
And in arranging the marriage,
you lied to the authorities?

1072
I, um, did not tell the truth
to the authorities.

1073
- You lied to them?
- Yes.

1074
And in the ceremony, when you swore
to love, honour and cherish your husband,

1075
- that too was a lie?
- Yes.

1076
And when the police questioned you
about this wretched man

1077
who believed himself married and loved,

1078
- you told them...
- I told them what he wanted me to.

1079
You told them that he was at home
with you at 25 minutes past 9,

1080
- and now you say that that was a lie?
- Yes, a lie!

1081
And when you said that he had
accidentally cut his wrist, again, you lied?

1082
- Yes!
- And today you told a new story entirely.

1083
The question is, Frau Helm,
were you lying then, are you lying now?

1084
Or are you not, in fact,
a chronic and habitual liar?!

1085
Carter, Carter!
The other pill. Under the tongue.

1086
My lord, is my learned friend to be
allowed to bully and insult the witness?

1087
Mr Myers, this is a capital charge
and, within the bounds of reason,

1088
I should like the defence
to have every latitude.

1089
My lord, may I also
remind my learned friend

1090
that his witness, by her own admission,
has already violated so many oaths

1091
that I am surprised the Testament
did not leap from her hand

1092
when she was sworn here today.

1093
I doubt if anything is to be gained
by questioning you any further.

1094
That will be all, Frau Helm.

1095
Mrs Helm, I presume you know the
meaning of the English word "perjury"?

1096
- In German, the word is Meineid.
- Yes. Meineid.

1097
It means to swear falsely under oath.

1098
And are you aware, Mrs Helm,

1099
that the penalty in this country for perjury
is a heavy term of imprisonment?

1100
Yes, I'm aware.

1101
Mindful of this fact, I ask you once more,
is the evidence that you have given

1102
the truth, the whole truth
and nothing but the truth?

1103
So help me, God.

1104
Then that, my lord,
is the case for the prosecution.

1105
- Want a tissue?
- Yes, thanks.

1106
It's the first murder trial
I've ever been to. It's terrible.

1107
Silence.

1108
Sir Wilfrid.
Are you ready for the defence?

1109
My lord, members of the jury,

1110
the prosecution has very ably presented
against the prisoner, Leonard Vole,

1111
a case with the most overwhelming
circumstantial evidence.

1112
Among the witnesses you have heard
Chief Inspector Hearne,

1113
who has given his testimony in a fair
and impartial manner, as he always does.

1114
He has put before you a clever theory
of how this crime was committed.

1115
Whether it is theory
or actual fact, however,

1116
you will decide for yourselves.

1117
And then you have heard
the evidence of Janet McKenzie,

1118
a worthy and devoted housekeeper who
has suffered two most grievous losses.

1119
One, the death of her beloved mistress

1120
and, second, in being deprived
of an inheritance of L80,000,

1121
which she'd fully expected to receive.

1122
I will not comment
further on her evidence,

1123
but will express only
my deepest sympathy for her

1124
in both these... mishaps.

1125
And most damaging of all, the prosecution
has produced a surprise witness,

1126
one Christine Helm, whom the prisoner
brought from the rubble of her homeland

1127
to the safety of this country, giving her
his love and the protection of his name.

1128
I objected to her testimony
because a wife cannot give evidence

1129
harmful to her husband.

1130
But it has been proven that her marriage
to Mr Vole was fraudulent and bigamous.

1131
Therefore, her evidence must be admitted
and you must consider it.

1132
For what it is worth.

1133
Such is the prosecution's case.
Now it is the turn of the defence.

1134
We could present, on behalf of
the prisoner, witnesses to his character,

1135
his war record, the lack of criminal
or evil association in his past.

1136
However, only one witness
can shed new light

1137
on this tragic riddle.

1138
The prisoner himself.

1139
Members of the jury,

1140
I call Leonard Stephen Vole.

1141
I swear by Almighty God
that the evidence I give will be the truth,

1142
- the whole truth and nothing but the truth.
- No.

1143
- Is your name Leonard Stephen Vole?
- It is.

1144
- Where do live?
- 620 Edgware Road.

1145
Leonard Stephen Vole, did you or did
you not on the night of October 14 last,

1146
murder Emily Jane French?

1147
- I did not.
- Thank you, that will be all.

1148
Have you, in fact, concluded your
examination of the prisoner, Sir Wilfrid?

1149
The prisoner has endured three days
of profound mental agony and shock.

1150
The defence feels
his faculties should be spared

1151
for the cross-examination
by my learned friend for the prosecution.

1152
This is not a plea for any indulgence.

1153
I am confident that
no matter how searching this may be,

1154
the prisoner will withstand it.

1155
At the time you made the acquaintance
of Mrs French, were you employed?

1156
- No, sir.
- How much money did you have?

1157
- A few pounds.
- Did she give you any?

1158
No.

1159
- Did you expect to receive any?
- No, sir.

1160
Did you know that in her new will,
you were the beneficiary of L80,000?

1161
No, I didn't.

1162
Now, Mr Vole, when you went to visit
Mrs French for the last time,

1163
did you wear a trench coat
and a brown hat?

1164
- Yes, I did.
- Was it this coat and hat?

1165
Yes, sir.

1166
My lord, the defence, in its efforts
to establish an alibi for the prisoner,

1167
circulated this photograph,
hoping to bring forth a witness

1168
who had seen him leaving
Mrs French's house or entering his own

1169
at the times that he has stated.

1170
Apparently, this splendid effort
was without results.

1171
However, the defence
will be pleased to learn

1172
that, at the last moment,
a witness has come forward,

1173
and that the prisoner had been
seen wearing this coat and this hat.

1174
Lamentably, he had not been seen on the
night of the murder but one week before.

1175
On the afternoon of October 8, were you
not in a travel agency in Regent Street?

1176
And did you not make inquiries about
prices and schedules of foreign cruises?

1177
Supposing I did? It's not a crime, is it?

1178
Not at all. Many people go on a cruise
when they can afford to pay for it.

1179
- But you couldn't pay for it, could you?
- Well, I was hard up. I told you that.

1180
And yet you came to this particular
travel agency with a clinging brunette?

1181
A clinging brunette, Mr Myers?

1182
My lord, the lady was so described to me.

1183
She was very affectionate with the
prisoner, constantly clinging to his arm.

1184
Oh.

1185
You then admit that you made inquiries
about expensive and luxurious cruises?

1186
How did you expect
to pay for such a thing?

1187
- I don't know. It was...
- If you don't know, perhaps I can help.

1188
On the morning of the very same day,
you heard Mrs French change her will,

1189
- leaving you the bulk of her money.
- I didn't!

1190
And in the afternoon,
you started plans to dispose of it.

1191
No! It was nothing of the kind.

1192
I was in a pub and I met a girl.
I don't even remember her name.

1193
We had a drink and walked out together.

1194
We passed the window and saw the fancy
posters, all blue seas and palm trees.

1195
The Grecian isles or somewhere. We went
in for fun and I started asking for folders.

1196
Well, the man gave me a funny look
because I did look a bit shabby.

1197
Anyway, it irritated me,
so I kept asking for the swankiest tours,

1198
all de luxe and cabin on the boat deck,
but it was just an act!

1199
An act? You knew that in a week
you were going to inherit L80,000!

1200
No! It wasn't that way at all.
It was make-believe and childish but...

1201
it was fun and I enjoyed it. I never thought
of killing anyone or inheriting any money.

1202
It's just a coincidence that Mrs French
should be killed only one week later?

1203
I told you! I didn't kill her!

1204
Do you know any reason why Christine
Helm should give the evidence she has

1205
- if it were not true?
- No. I don't know why my wife...

1206
I don't know why I still call her my wife.
She must be lying or out of her mind.

1207
She seemed remarkably
sane and self-possessed.

1208
- But insanity is all you can suggest?
- I don't understand it.

1209
Oh, God! What's happened?
What's changed her?

1210
Very effective, I'm sure.
But in this court we deal with fact.

1211
And the fact, Mr Vole,
is that we've only your word for it.

1212
That you left Mrs French's house
at the time you say,

1213
that you came home at 5 and 20 minutes
past 9, and that you did not go out again!

1214
Somebody must have seen me
in the street or going in the house!

1215
One would think so. But the only person
who did see you come home that night

1216
says it was ten past ten
and that you had blood on your hands.

1217
- I cut my wrist!
- You cut your wrist deliberately!

1218
No, I didn't! I didn't do anything.

1219
But you make it sound as though I did.
I can hear it myself.

1220
You came home at ten past ten!

1221
No, I didn't! You've got to believe me.
You've got to believe me!

1222
You killed Emily French!

1223
No, I didn't! I didn't do it!

1224
I didn't kill her! I never killed anybody!

1225
God, it's like a nightmare.
Some ghastly, horrible dream.

1226
Good evening, Sir Wilfrid.
How did it go today?

1227
Oh, Sir Wilfrid.

1228
I'm from Hawks and Hill, sir, and I've
brought your Bermuda shorts for a fitting.

1229
What?

1230
- You'd better slip these on, Sir Wilfrid.
- I'm in the middle of a murder trial.

1231
It'll all be over by the afternoon,
and the boat train doesn't go until 9.40.

1232
You work it out. You know my shape,
you've stabbed it often enough.

1233
Upstairs. You need a lukewarm bath
and your calcium injection.

1234
And there's a lot more packing to be done.

1235
It's ridiculous having boat reservations.
The jury may be out for days.

1236
Not on this case, I'm afraid.
It seems too open-and-shut.

1237
I watched when Frau Helm
was on the stand. They didn't like her.

1238
No, but they believed her. They liked
Leonard Vole but they didn't believe him.

1239
And that travel agency business
doesn't help either. Cigar?

1240
No.

1241
- Wilfrid, do you think she lied?
- Well, don't you?

1242
I'm not sure.

1243
I am. She lied. Whether she calls it
Meineid or perjury, she lied.

1244
The only question is why. What's
her game? What is she up to? What?

1245
I hope that in your final speech you
won't become too emotionally involved.

1246
- You must think of your condition.
- He's right.

1247
I want to see you save yourself.
This isn't going to be your last case.

1248
Yes, it is. But until it's over,
I'm still a barrister.

1249
My client's life is at stake.
That's all that matters - his life.

1250
He's entitled to the best that I can do.

1251
If I can't stand up to make my final appeal
for him, I'll make it sitting down.

1252
If I become short of breath I'll take a pill,
or two pills, or all of them and the box too.

1253
- Yes?
- This Sir Wilfrid Robarts' place?

1254
- Well, yes, it is.
- Let me talk to the old geezer.

1255
- Who is this speaking, please?
- Never you mind. Let me talk to 'im.

1256
I'm afraid that's impossible.
What is the nature of your business?

1257
It's business all right.
I've got something to sell 'im, I 'ave.

1258
Well, really, madam!

1259
And what I want to sell 'im,
believe me, 'e'll want to buy.

1260
- It's got to do with that Leonard Vole.
- Leonard Vole?

1261
It's about that German wife.

1262
I've got the goods on her and it's for sale.

1263
This is Wilfrid Robarts speaking.
Now, what is this all about?

1264
Well, hello, ducky.

1265
What is this you said
about Mrs Leonard Vole?

1266
I'm not just saying.
I've got it in black and white.

1267
- You've got what?
- Listen to this carefully, ducks.

1268
I'm at the buffet at Euston Station
at the far end of the bar.

1269
I'll be here for 30 minutes
because that's when me train leaves.

1270
If you want the lowdown on
that German bag, get yourself here.

1271
What lowdown?
What do you know about her?

1272
Uh-uh. Not on the phone.

1273
You'd better get on over here,
and bring plenty of money.

1274
Now, just a moment! Hello? Hello?

1275
That's... bilge. Some drunken crank.
You get those in every murder trial.

1276
Giving me an ultimatum, Euston Station in
30 minutes. Got the lowdown on Mrs Vole.

1277
Balderdash.

1278
I'm too old and too sick
to go on a wild-goose chase.

1279
- Come on, Mayhew.
- Where to, Sir Wilfrid?

1280
Euston Station, where do you think?

1281
Now, sir?

1282
Shortly.

1283
Cigar!

1284
Sir Wilfrid, where are you going?

1285
Your bath, your massage,
your dinner, your injection!

1286
Thank you, Miss Plimsoll.

1287
- You wouldn't be Sir Wilfrid, would you?
- I would.

1288
Didn't recognise you without your wig.
Lovely you all look in them wigs.

1289
Two o' yer? I'm not talking to two o' yer.

1290
This is Mr Mayhew,
Leonard Vole's solicitor.

1291
- Well, that's all right, then.
- And your name, please?

1292
No need for mine. If I did give you a name
it mightn't be the right one, might it?

1293
'Ave a drink, boys.
Two whiskies for me gen'Imen friends.

1294
Now what is this information
you allegedly have?

1295
You realise that you're duty-bound
to give any evidence that you might have?

1296
- Come off it. Did you bring any money?
- What is it you have, madam?

1297
Letters. Letters that German wife
of 'is wrote. That's what I've got.

1298
- Letters written to the prisoner?
- To the prisoner? Don't make me laugh.

1299
Poor bleeder, he's been took in
by 'er all right. And these letters prove it.

1300
If we could see these letters, we could
advise you as to how pertinent they are.

1301
Well, I don't expect you...

1302
Well, as I say, I don't expect you
to buy without seeing, but fair's fair.

1303
If these letters get the boy off,
it's L100 for me, right?

1304
If these letters contain information useful
to the defence, I'm prepared to offer L10.

1305
What? Ten bleeding pounds
for letters like these?

1306
Take that piece of glass
out o' yer eye. Good night.

1307
If these help prove my client's innocence,

1308
L20 should, I think, not be an
unreasonable sum for your expenses.

1309
50 and it's a bargain.
That's if you're satisfied with 'em.

1310
- L40.
- All right, blast yer.

1311
'Ere, take 'em. Nice little lot there.

1312
How do we know
these are from Mrs Vole?

1313
Oh, she wrote 'em all right.
It's all fair an' square.

1314
I 'ope they fix 'er good and proper.

1315
I've had messages from Mrs Vole.
It looks like her handwriting.

1316
Good heavens, look at this.

1317
Juicy, ain't they?

1318
- There's one that's even better.
- How did you get hold of these?

1319
What's the difference
so long as she gets what's coming?

1320
- What have you got against her?
- Ha!

1321
I'll give you something
to dream about, mister.

1322
Want to kiss me, ducky?

1323
Ha!

1324
- I didn't suppose you would.
- Christine Vole did that to you?

1325
Not 'er, the chap I was going with. He was
a bit younger than me but I loved 'im.

1326
Then she come along, started seeing 'im
on the sly. Then one day he cleared out.

1327
I found 'em together. I said what I thought
of 'er and he cut me face up proper.

1328
- Did you go to the police about it?
- Who, me? Not likely.

1329
It wasn't 'is fault. It was all 'ers, gettin' 'im
away from me, turnin' 'im against me.

1330
But I waited me time to pay 'er back.
And it's come now.

1331
I'm deeply sorry, deeply sorry.
We'll make it another L5 for the letters.

1332
'Olding out on me, were yer?
I knew I was being soft with yer.

1333
Cold-blooded vindictiveness.
Read this one.

1334
Unbelievable.

1335
We'd better have the full name of the man
to whom these were addressed, Miss...

1336
Miss, um...

1337
Where is she?

1338
On that train, I should think. Doesn't want
her other cheek slashed. Can't blame her.

1339
- Care for another, sir?
- Hm?

1340
Good idea.

1341
Silence!

1342
Be upstanding in court.

1343
All persons who have anything
to do before my lords,

1344
the queen's justices of oyer and terminer

1345
and general jail delivery for the
jurisdiction of the Central Criminal Court,

1346
draw near and give your attendance.
God save the queen.

1347
Since the defence has called
but one witness, the prisoner,

1348
it has the right to be heard last.

1349
Mr Myers, if you are ready, let us have
the final address for the prosecution.

1350
My lord, members of the jury,
I will be brief in my final speech

1351
because I think we've proved so obvious
a case of murder against Leonard Vole,

1352
that a verdict of guilty
must be the only possible conclusion.

1353
I will briefly summarise these facts...

1354
You'd better begin again, Mr Myers.

1355
That is, if Sir Wilfrid
is at all interested in our proceedings.

1356
I am, indeed, my lord. The speech
for the crown, however, is premature.

1357
I ask that the case for the defence be
reopened. And that a witness be recalled.

1358
I most strenuously object to the case
being reopened at this final stage.

1359
Evidence of a startling nature
has come into my possession.

1360
The course my learned friend
proposes is quite unprecedented.

1361
I have anticipated this objection
and can meet it with ample precedent.

1362
There is the king vs Stillman, reported
in the criminal appeal reports of 1926

1363
at page 463.

1364
Also, the king vs Porter in volume one
of the king's bench division reports,

1365
1942 at page 153.

1366
And lastly there is the case
of the king vs Sullivan

1367
in which this issue was raised, which
I'm sure Your Lordship will remember,

1368
since you appeared for the prosecution.

1369
I did? Oh, yes, before Mr Justice Swindon.

1370
What is this new evidence, Sir Wilfrid?

1371
Letters, my lord.

1372
Letters written by Christine Helm.

1373
My lord, the prosecution
continues its objection.

1374
If my memory serves me well,
Your Lordship's similar objection

1375
in the king against Sullivan
was sustained.

1376
Your memory, for once,
serves you ill, Mr Myers.

1377
My objection then was overruled
by Mr Justice Swindon.

1378
As yours is now, by me.

1379
Call Christine Helm.

1380
Christine Helm.

1381
- Christine Helm.
- Christine Helm.

1382
If you still have doubts about Mr Vole, I
wouldn't mind betting you a box of cigars.

1383
Mrs Helm, you appreciate
you are still under oath?

1384
Yes.

1385
- Do you know a man named Max?
- I don't know what you mean.

1386
It's a simple question. Do you
or do you not know a man called Max?

1387
Max? Certainly not.

1388
It's a fairly common name and yet
you've never known a man named Max?

1389
In Germany, perhaps, but a long time ago.

1390
I shall not ask you to go back that far.
Just a few weeks, to... October 20 last.

1391
- What have you got there?
- A letter.

1392
I suggest that on October 20

1393
- you wrote a letter...
- I don't know what you're talking about.

1394
...addressed to a man named Max.
- I did nothing of the sort.

1395
The letter was but one of a series
written to the same man.

1396
Lies! All lies!

1397
You seem to have been, well, let us say,
on intimate terms with this man.

1398
How dare you say a thing like that?
It isn't true!

1399
I'm not concerned with the general trend
of this correspondence, only one letter.

1400
"My beloved Max,
an extraordinary thing has happened. "

1401
"I believe all our difficulties
may be ended. "

1402
I will not stand here
and listen to a pack of lies!

1403
That letter's a forgery.
It isn't even my letter paper!

1404
- It isn't?
- No!

1405
I write my letters on small blue paper
with my initials on it.

1406
Like this?

1407
This is a bill from my tailor for a pair
of extremely becoming Bermuda shorts.

1408
Wilfrid the fox! That's what we call him
and that's what he is.

1409
Now, Mrs Helm, you've been kind enough
to identify your letter paper.

1410
Now, if you like, I can have an expert
identify your handwriting.

1411
Damn you!

1412
- Damn you!
- Leave her alone!

1413
- Damn you!
- Mrs Helm!

1414
Let me go!
Let me get out of here! Let me go!

1415
- Mrs Helm!
- Let me go!

1416
Usher, get the witness a chair.

1417
Sir Wilfrid, will you now read the letter
in question so that the jury may hear it?

1418
"My beloved Max,
an extraordinary thing has happened. "

1419
"All our difficulties may soon be solved. "

1420
"Leonard is suspected of murdering
the old lady I told you about. "

1421
"His only hope of an alibi
depends on me and me alone. "

1422
"Suppose I testify that he was not at home
with me at the time of the murder,

1423
that he came home
with blood on his sleeves,

1424
and that he even admitted to me
that he'd killed her?"

1425
"Strange that he always said
he would never let me leave him. "

1426
"But now, if this succeeds,
he will be leaving me

1427
because they will take him away forever

1428
and I shall be free and yours,
my beloved. "

1429
"I count the hours until
we are together. Christine. "

1430
Mrs Helm?
Will you go back to the witness box?

1431
I now ask you again, Christine Helm,
did you write this letter?

1432
Christine, tell him you didn't write it.
I know you didn't.

1433
Please answer my question.
Did you write this letter?

1434
Before answering, Mrs Helm,

1435
I wish to warn you that the law regarding
perjury in this country is very severe.

1436
If you have already
committed perjury in this courtroom,

1437
I strongly advise you
not to add to your crime.

1438
But, if this letter
has not been written by you,

1439
then now is the time to state this fact.

1440
I wrote the letter.

1441
And that, my lord,
is the case for the defence.

1442
I keep asking which is harder,
your head or your arteries?

1443
Stop pressing your luck, you're overdue.

1444
We're all packed and ready.
I hope the jury won't take all afternoon.

1445
I concede.

1446
- Congratulations, here are your cigars.
- Not yet.

1447
Come on, it's all over,
wrapped up neat and tidy.

1448
- What's wrong?
- It's a little too neat, too tidy,

1449
and altogether too symmetrical,
that's what's wrong with it.

1450
- The jury is back.
- You're not worried about the verdict?

1451
It's not their judgment
that worries me, it's mine.

1452
Come along.

1453
Where's my wig?

1454
The prisoner will stand up.

1455
Members of the jury,
are you all agreed upon your verdict?

1456
We are.

1457
Do you find the prisoner at the bar,
Leonard Stephen Vole,

1458
guilty or not guilty
of the murder of Emily Jane French?

1459
Not guilty, m'lord.

1460
Silence!

1461
Silence!

1462
Leonard Stephen Vole,
you have been found not guilty

1463
of the murder
of Emily Jane French on October 14.

1464
You are hereby discharged
and are free to leave the court.

1465
Persons with anything more to do
before the queen's justices

1466
of oyer and terminer and jail delivery

1467
for the jurisdiction of the Central
Criminal Court may depart the area.

1468
Thank you. Yes, we'll talk later.
Thank you, Mr Mayhew.

1469
Thank you, Mr Brogan-Moore. Carter.

1470
Thank you, Sir Wilfrid, for everything.
You were wonderful.

1471
- I'd say we were lucky all around.
- Yeah.

1472
I have your belongings. Sign the receipt,
Mr Vole, and we can release you.

1473
"Mr Vole. " They didn't call me Mr
when they charged me.

1474
- I'll go with you, I have your hat and coat.
- Let's go before they change their mind!

1475
Chipper, isn't he? An hour ago,
he had one foot on the gallows

1476
and the other on a banana peel.

1477
You ought to be very proud, Wilfrid.
Aren't you?

1478
Not yet. We've disposed of the gallows,

1479
but there's still that banana peel
somewhere, under somebody's foot.

1480
- Every word you said was a lie!
- You ought to be locked up! Liar!

1481
You'd better wait here
until we get rid of that crowd, madam.

1482
Thank you.

1483
Ready, sir? Miss Plimsoll will be waiting.

1484
Let me finish the last of the cocoa
while I'm still beyond her jurisdiction.

1485
Would you excuse me,
Brogan-Moore, Carter? Thank you.

1486
I never thought you British could get
so emotional. Especially in public.

1487
- I apologise for my compatriots.
- It's all right.

1488
I don't mind being called names or
pushed around or even kicked in the shin.

1489
But I have a ladder
in my last pair of nylons.

1490
In case you are not familiar with
our prison regulations, no silk stockings.

1491
Prison? Will I go to prison?

1492
You heard the judge.
You will certainly be charged with perjury,

1493
- tried for it, and to prison you shall go.
- Well, it won't be for life, will it?

1494
If I were appearing
for the prosecution, it would be.

1495
You loathe me, don't you?
Like the people outside.

1496
What a wicked woman I am,
and how brilliantly you exposed me

1497
and saved Leonard's life.
The great Sir Wilfrid Robarts did it again.

1498
Well, let me tell you something.
You didn't do it alone. You had help.

1499
What are you driving at?

1500
I'm not driving at anything.
Leonard is free and we did it.

1501
- We?
- Remember?

1502
When you said that no jury would
believe an alibi given by a loving wife,

1503
no matter how much she swore
he was innocent? That gave me the idea.

1504
What idea?

1505
The idea that I should be a witness, not
for my husband, but for the prosecution.

1506
That I should swear Leonard was guilty
and that you should expose me as a liar

1507
because only then would they believe
Leonard was innocent.

1508
So now you know
the whole story, Sir Wilfrid.

1509
I'll give yer something
to dream about, mister.

1510
Want to kiss me, ducky?

1511
I suspected something, but not that.

1512
- Never that!
- Thank you for the compliment.

1513
It's been a long time since I acted
and I never played such a vital role.

1514
All those blue letters!

1515
It took me hours to write them,
to invent Max. There never was a Max.

1516
There's never been anyone but Leonard.

1517
My dear, could you not have trusted me,

1518
worked with me truthfully
and honourably? We would have won.

1519
I could not run that risk.
You thought he was innocent.

1520
And you knew he was innocent.
I understand.

1521
No, Sir Wilfrid,
you do not understand at all.

1522
I knew he was guilty.

1523
That can't be true! No!

1524
Listen to me, once and for all.

1525
He came home after ten,
he had blood on his sleeves,

1526
he said he had killed the woman,
only I could save him. He pleaded.

1527
And you saved him? A murderer?

1528
Again, you don't understand.

1529
I love him.

1530
I told you she was an actress.
And a good one.

1531
Leonard!

1532
I knew she'd do something,
but I just didn't know what or how.

1533
Leonard, Leonard.

1534
- Fooled you completely, didn't she?
- It was you, Vole, who fooled me.

1535
Oh, easy. Easy. We both got
out of this alive, let's stay this way.

1536
- Where are your pills?
- You've made a mockery of English law.

1537
Who did? You got me off
and I can't be tried again for this.

1538
- That's English law too, isn't it?
- You can't touch him now. Nobody can.

1539
The scales of justice
may tip one way or another,

1540
but ultimately they balance out.
You'll pay for this.

1541
Ultimately's a long way off. I'd rather
pay for it as soon as possible and in cash.

1542
Suppose we double your fee? There'll be
lots of money once the will goes through.

1543
I'm not cheap, I want everybody
to get something out of it.

1544
There's Janet McKenzie.
We'll get her that new hearing aid.

1545
And we'll get you a new one of these.
18-carat gold if they make them.

1546
And when they try you for perjury
there'll be L5,000 for the defence.

1547
I don't care, just so we'll be together.
You don't know what I've been through.

1548
Standing in the witness box, having
to face you, saying I never loved you.

1549
What is it, Leonard?

1550
The luggage is in the car and we've
only 20 minutes to catch the boat train.

1551
This is a nice young lady
I met during the trial.

1552
Len!

1553
Oh, Len!

1554
Len...

1555
Oh, Len, they've been trying to keep
me away. It's had me nearly crazy.

1556
Leonard, who's this girl?

1557
I'm not this girl, I'm his girl.

1558
Tell her, Len.

1559
Leonard, is this the girl
who was with you in the travel bureau?

1560
The girl you said you hardly knew,
didn't even know her name?

1561
That's right. That's who I am and I know
all about you. You're not his wife.

1562
Never have been. You're years older than
he is. We've been together for months

1563
and we're going away on a cruise,
just like they said in court. Tell her, Len.

1564
- Yes, Len, tell me yourself.
- All right, Diana, come along.

1565
You can't, not after what I've done.
I won't let you.

1566
I saved your life
getting you out of Germany,

1567
you got me out of this mess,
so we're even. It's over now.

1568
Don't, Leonard! Don't leave me!
Don't, Leonard! Don't!

1569
Pull yourself together.
They'll have you up for perjury.

1570
Don't make it worse
or they'll try you as an accessory.

1571
And you know what that means.

1572
I don't care. Let them. Let them try me
for perjury, or an accessory, or...

1573
- Ready?
- Or better yet...

1574
let them try me for...!

1575
Argh!

1576
- Call a doctor.
- It's no use. No doctor can help now.

1577
- What happened?
- She killed him.

1578
Killed him?

1579
She executed him.

1580
Carter, what have you done
with the luggage?

1581
I sent it on ahead to the station,
and I've got a cab waiting outside.

1582
- A remarkable woman.
- You can just barely catch the boat train.

1583
Better bring the luggage back,
and you can dismiss the cab.

1584
We are not going yet, are we?

1585
Thank you, Miss Plimsoll.

1586
Get Brogan-Moore to my chambers,
and Mayhew too.

1587
We're appearing for the defence
in the trial of Christine Vole.

1588
Sir Wilfrid?

1589
You've forgotten your brandy.

1590
The management of this theatre suggests

1591
that for the greater entertainment of
friends who have not yet seen the picture,

1592
you will not divulge to anyone
the secret of the ending

1593
of "Witness For The Prosecution".
